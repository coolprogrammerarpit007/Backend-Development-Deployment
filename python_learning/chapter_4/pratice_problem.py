# Python Data Structures Lists and Tuples

# Lists are Mutable whereas Tuples are Immutables.
# Tuples are comparitively much faster then Lists 
# Tuples are recommended to use where data is constant 

# planets = ("EARTH","MARS","VENUS","MURCURY","JUPYTER")
# print(planets[0])

# Practice Problems

# fruits = []

# index = 0
# for index in range(7):
#     fruit = input("Enter Fruit Name: ")
#     fruits.append(fruit)


# print(fruits)


# student_marks = []

# index = 0
# for index in range(6):
#     student_mark = int(input("Enter Student Marks out of 100: "))
#     student_marks.append(student_mark)

# print(student_marks)
# print("Student Marks in the sorted order: ")
# print(student_marks)

# numbers = [12,23,78,95]
# total = 0

# for number in numbers:
#     total += number


# print(f"Total of all Numbers inside List: {total}")

# count the number of zeros in the tuple

# a = (7,0,8,0,0,9)

# count_zeros = a.count(0)
# print(f"Number of Zeros: {count_zeros}")
